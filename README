2.For the I/O of this assignment, I just hard code the data.

3.I used a vector to contain the path between states. for example,
array[i][j] is the distance from city_i to city_j

4. I used floyd algorithm to find the shortest path.

5.For the testing, just type in "./Find.exe" on terminal, and it will give out the result for the shortest path.
